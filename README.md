## In-Memory Distributed Indexing for Large-Scale Media Data Retrieval
## Background
Data retrieval serves a critical role in the development of multimedia applications. However, due to the exponential growth of multimedia data, high-speed and efficient indexing is becoming more and more difficult than ever. 
## Goal
Propose a novel approach to speed up the retrieval process by adopting a distributed computing paradigm through the Apache Spark framework. Utilizing search trees in a Big Data ecosystem leads to fast and cost-effective media database retrievals by caching indexing structures into memory and aggregating ranked results with flexibilities for users to specify the importance of search cues.
## Data
first is a set of 397 pollen images, then a set of 1.4M temporal satelliteimage chips.
## Tool
Java, Spark, Slurm Workload Manager
